A weekly reading group on human centred computing with a focus on safety, security, and privacy. The group will include close readings of academic papers and presentations of works in progress, particularly those applying interdisciplinary approaches to socio-technical subjects. Therefore topics will include both ‘technical’ areas like machine learning and qualitative or ‘social’ subjects like the home as a research area.

The group will meet on Fridays at 2pm BST via Teams – all are welcome to join. Please email Julia Slupska to be added to our Teams channel.

The reading group is convened by Julia Slupska and Martin Kraemer. Website by Konrad Kollnig.
